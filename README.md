# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run build` fails to minify



1. Accessibility and SEO
I used semantic HTML elements such as <main>, <nav>, and <header> throughout my frontend to improve accessibility. I provided descriptive alt text for all images and ensured that the application can be navigated using only the keyboard. To enhance SEO, I dynamically set page titles and meta descriptions where appropriate. I also included ARIA attributes where necessary to support users who rely on screen readers.

2. Tracking-privacy
I implemented simple pageview tracking using Google Analytics because it respects user privacy and does not use cookies or collect personal data. This helps me understand how users interact with the application while remaining compliant with GDPR. I also make sure users are informed about this tracking in the privacy notice.

3.Security
y project could be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and NoSQL Injection. To mitigate XSS, I rely on Reactâ€™s default escaping and avoid using dangerouslySetInnerHTML. All user input is validated and sanitized before rendering. For NoSQL Injection, I check that all MongoDB IDs are valid using mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid() before querying, and I use strict Mongoose schemas to enforce data types. I also set CORS headers to restrict API access and regularly check dependencies with npm audit to address known vulnerabilities. If I add authentication, I will use HTTP-only cookies for sensitive tokens.
